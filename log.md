# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 02, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Furniture Shop LP, I worked on html markup

**Thoughts:** It's annoying to have to switch from html markup in code editor to work on exporting images from Figma.

### Day 1: August 03, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Furniture Shop LP. Added webpack config & webpack dependencies. Created app.js & app.scss files (with imported normalize.css)

**Thoughts:** It's was dificult to configure webpack, because i don't have work experience with this tool & even don't know its core concepts.
